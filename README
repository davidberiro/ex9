Main.jack - The main file which runs Game.jack  

Snake.jack - The snake class which represents our snake in the game. Each
part of the body is represented as a location in an Array, and each time the
snake eats food another body part is added to the back of the snake by editing
the array

Game.jack - The class which implements the snake game by using the Snake class.
The game ends when the snake eats 4 pieces of food, and the player loses
by either colliding into the "wall" or colliding into himself.
