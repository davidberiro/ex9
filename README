README - This file

Parser.py - The Parser module built according to the specifications that were
online. Handles the parsing of a single .vm file, and encapsulates access to
the input code. It reads VM commands, parses them, and provides convenient 
access to their components. Although unlike the specifications online we do
NOT modify the original file by removing any white spaces or comments

CodeWriter.py - The module that does the actual translation from VM code to
jack assembly code. 

VMtranslator.py - The main code which runs everything. receives as input either
a directory or a .vm file. In the case of a directory, any .vm files found
inside the directory will all be translated into one .asm file (one file
named after the directory). In the case of one .avm file, we produce a translated
.asm file inside the same directory with the same name.
